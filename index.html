            <p id="memberAnchor">Welcome to <strong>AURA</strong>. We are a student-led development team at Michigan State University. This semester, we will be designing and building three major projects using programming tools such as Rails and React. Our team is made up of four members which each bring a unique perspective and skill set to the project. Together, we aim to compose high-quality results while collaborating and learning new technologies.</p>
